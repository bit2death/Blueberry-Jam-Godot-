# Blueberry-Jam-Godot-
You're an alien and you've crash-landed in a blueberry jam factory! You coincidentally look the size, and color of a blueberry!  Get back to your ship and escape earth!

## installation instructions:
```
1. Change branch to "master"
2. download as zip
3. unzip
4. Open with Godot 4.3
5. In the top right, there should be a play button
```

This is incomplete, and I let this project linger on too long.
As of now, there's only one demo room, basic movement, and some buggy slope movement.
